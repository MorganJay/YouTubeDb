# YouTubeDb
 You find yourself as the newest dev in Google, your first task is to redesign a database for a lighter version of Youtube that should 
 give the users the ability to monetize their videos and also have a function/procedure to compute the profit on videos they make based 
 on the countries they posted from using their exchange rate and also functions to let a viewer know how many hours he has spent on 
 YouTube and also let the youtuber know how many times his video has been watched.
